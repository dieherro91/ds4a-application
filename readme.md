## About The Project

_Description_
Not being aware of the travel patterns of people moving within the city can generate logistical problems such as the desynchronization of public transport system schedules and passenger's offer-demand, or buses covering the same route at the same time, causing excessive waiting times for the next available bus and increasing costs for the bus operator. .

That is why solutions are required to Maximize occupancy of the vehicles of the Integrated Public Transport System (SITP) to minimize operational costs.
